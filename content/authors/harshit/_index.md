I am a junior undergraduate at IIT Kanpur, pursuing a bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Machine Learning. My main areas of interest are computer vision and signal processing, and I have been working on problems in similar areas. 

I have been working under the guidance of Dr. Rajesh Hegde, IIT Kanpur on problems related to localization and tracking of static and moving sources of sound. I have also worked with the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India, under the guidance of Dr. Sumit Chowdhury, on the task of TV audience measurement using ML algorithms.
